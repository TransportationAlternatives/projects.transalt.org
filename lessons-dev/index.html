              <p class="pt-3">In 2014, New York City launched the first Vision Zero program in the United States — pledging to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries. New York’s effort was inspired by Sweden, which enacted a similar policy in 1997 and which subsequently spread across the U.S. and Europe, leading to the elimination of traffic deaths in cities from Oslo to Helsinki to Hoboken.</p>
              <p>In service of this pledge, over the past ten years, the City of New York launched a wide range of safety interventions including, but not limited to: lowering the citywide speed limit, installing the automated speed safety cameras, pedestrianizing acres of road space, building more than 200 miles of protected bike lanes, equipping the city fleet with truck side guards and “Intelligent Speed Assist” speed governors, developing public education campaigns, and increasing police enforcement. Some of these efforts have been effective; others have been less so.</p>

                <p class="chart-label">New York City’s leaders both failed to meet the needs of a changing city, and too readily surrendered safety to the convenience of drivers and their desire for free parking for their cars. As a result, fatalities plateaued and rose.</p>
              <div id="allfatals" style="height:600px;"></div>
              <p class="chart-other">According to DOT: From 2021, the 'E-Micromobility/Other Motorized' category includes victims riding standing e-scooters and moped-style devices that cannot be legally defined as e-bikes, e-scooters, or motorcycles. The victims were previously categorized as pedestrians, bicycles, or motorcycles, depending on specific type.</p>

                <p>Traffic fatalities in the decade preceding Vision Zero were 16% higher than in the past ten years -- a difference of more than 400 lives. But while significant progress has been made, the story of Vision Zero in New York City is neither simple nor linear. For example, pedestrian fatalities in the city have declined 30% in the past 10 years, at a time when traffic fatalities, and especially pedestrian fatalities, are surging nationwide. Yet, in that time, driver fatalities rose more than 11%, especially in Black and Latino neighborhoods. Cyclist fatalities fluctuated dramatically — falling as low as 10 deaths one year and rising as high as 28 the next — generally trending upward all the while. 2023 marks the single deadliest year for cyclists since 1999, and the second deadliest year for cyclists in recorded history.</p>

              <p>Many Vision Zero efforts fall short by initiating change through a piecemeal rather than a systemwide approach. Officials will celebrate occasional and politically convenient interventions, but shy from the wholesale universal changes necessary to shift the status quo. </p>
              <p>New York City, for example, responsively redesigns streets after people have died, but fails to pre-emptively redesign identical streets where the same dangerous condition lay in wait. Other cities lower speed limits on only a limited number of streets, or implement automated enforcement programs on a limited number of the “most dangerous” streets while permitting violations elsewhere -- leading to increased risk on the streets without intervention. Rather than eliminating danger, danger is simply moved around in an unending game of whack-a-mole.</p>
              <p>By contrast, the most successful Vision Zero efforts are those implemented systemwide. For example, in 2014, New York City lowered its speed limit to 25 miles per hour and launched an automated speed safety camera program. Today, speed limits of 25 mph or less are the law on more than 90% of city streets, and the speed safety camera program, one of the largest in the world, operates 24 hours a day in school zones across the five boroughs. Together, these system-wide changes have been shown to change driver behavior, reduce crashes, speeding, injuries, and fatalities.</p>

                <p>The initial success of Vision Zero programs can plateau or even recede when city officials fail to track changing conditions on city streets and shift interventions to meet changing needs. Traffic fatality rates can shift based on factors as diverse as commuting trends, automobile design, even economics — but by targeting safety interventions to shifting conditions, city officials can save lives. 

                <p>For example, faced with the sudden risk of a viral pandemic and the rise in hyper-local travel born of a citywide shutdown, the City of New York closed streets to cars and opened them to people. The Open Streets program discouraged driving and made street spaces safe for people, and as a result, directly reduced crashes and injuries. In the past year, in response to a rise in cycling, cyclist fatalities, and increased crowding in bike lanes, the City constructed extra-wide bike lanes on 3rd and 10th avenues in Manhattan. Where pedestrians often spilled into the street on crowded sidewalks in Midtown, the City widened sidewalks on 9th and 10th avenues. But all of these adaptations are only recent, extremely piecemeal, and centralized in the wealthiest neighborhoods.</p>

                <p>New York City has undergone massive, citywide changes in the Vision Zero era, but our approach to Vision Zero has not. Since 2014, New York City’s population has grown by more than 200,000 people. The number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has risen 16%, to a record high. The number of cycling trips has nearly doubled. And just since 2022, the number of SUV registrations in New York City has risen 103%. Each of these changes directly increase the likelihood of deadly conflict.

                  <p>There are more cars on the road, more cyclists on the road, more pedestrians in the crosswalks, and more SUVs than ever before. Each of these changes directly increase the likelihood of deadly conflict. Few efforts have been made to mitigate dangerous conditions.<p>
                    <p>In the same time period that cycling trips doubled, protected bike lane installation only increased by 45 percent, or 211 miles. As a result, 2023 was the second most deadly year in recorded history, and the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured in every 10,000 cycling trips rose between from 2019 and 2022.</p>

                   <p>In addition, as new SUV registrations rose, so did the percentage of children killed by large vehicles such as SUVs — 45% of children killed in the first five years of the Vision Zero era were killed by large vehicles whereas 74% of children killed in the latter five years of Vision Zero era were killed by large vehicles. </p>
                   <p>These trends — the growth of cycling, the popularity of larger personal vehicles, the rise in VMT — did not happen overnight. Failure to respond to these trends is indicative of a Vision Zero stuck in 2014, with deadly results.
