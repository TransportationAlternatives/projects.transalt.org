<p>Earlier this year, Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href="https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-intersections-redesigned-police-enforcement-nyc-traffic-safety/" target="_blank">promised to upgrade 1,000 intersections</a> across New York City for safety. These improvements could include installing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/nyregion/nyc-raised-crosswalks-traffic-deaths.html" target="_blank">raised crosswalks</a>, leading pedestrian intervals, shortening crossings, or other interventions.</p>
<p>The city has not comprehensively published where intersection upgrades have taken place or what metrics are being used to determine which intersections get improvements, so Transportation Alternatives's <a href="https://transalt.org/brooklyn" target="_blank">Brooklyn Activist Committee</a> is tracking the administration's commitment to meeting this goal.</p>
